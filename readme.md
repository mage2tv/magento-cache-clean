# Magento 2 Cache Clean

A faster drop in replacement for `bin/magento cache:clean` with a file watcher.

The file watcher automatically cleans affected cache types in the Magento 2
cache during development.
For example, if you make a change to a template, it only cleans the
`block_html` and `full_page` caches, not the `config` or `layout` caches.

The project is only tested on MacOS and Linux.
Please report bugs by opening an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/mage2tv/magento-cache-clean/issues).


## Features

* Supports file, redis and varnish cache backends
* Removes affected generated code classes when a source file is changed
* Zero configuration, all required information is read from `app/etc/env.php`
* Hotkeys for quick cache flushes while the watcher is running

## Installation & Updating

Installation:

``` shell
composer require --dev mage2tv/magento-cache-clean
```

Update:

``` shell
composer remove --dev mage2tv/magento-cache-clean
composer require --dev mage2tv/magento-cache-clean
```

The tool is commonly installed globally using `composer global require ...`.


## Usage

In your Magento directory, run `bin/cache-clean.js --watch`

Press `Ctrl-C` to exit the watcher process.

The script can also be used as a faster drop in replacement of `bin/magento cache:clean`.
For example:

``` shell
bin/cache-clean.js config full_page
```
(It's quicker because the start up time of `bin/magento` is so slow.)

There are several options to customize the behavior:

```
bin/cache-clean.js --help

Usage: cache-clean.js [options and flags] [cache-types...]
Clean the given cache types. If none are given, clean all cache types.

--directory|-d <dir>    Magento base directory
--watch|-w              Watch for file changes
--verbose|-v            Display more information
--debug|-vv             Display too much information
--silent|-s             Display less information
--version               Display the version
--help|-h               This help message
```

Usually I run the command once with the `--watch` switch when I start
development, and when I make a change that isn't automatically detected (yet),
I run `bin/cache-clean.js` with the given cache types as a drop in
replacement for `bin/magento cache:clean`.

### Hotkeys

When the watcher is running, segments of the cache can be cleaned with
individual keystrokes:

|Key|Cache Segment(s)|
|---|----------------|
|`c`| `config` |
|`b`| `block_html` |
|`l`| `layout` |
|`f`| `full_page` |
|`a`| (a for all) |
|`v`| (v for view) `block_html`, `layout`, `full_page` |
|`t`| `translate` |

There also are hotkeys to clean the static assets in the `A`dminhtml or
the `F`rontend area or clean the `G`enerated code directory.


### Prerequisites:

* `node.js` (built on 10.8, but should work with older 8.x versions, too).
* It probably is a good idea to turn on all Magento caches
  `bin/magento cache:enable` to get the full benefit.


## Known issues

* Currently the watcher has to be restarted after a new theme is added so it
  is added to the watchlist.

* Changes to files on NFS mounts (e.g. in vagrant) do not trigger the watches.
  Depending on a given setup, it might be possible to run the watcher on the
  host system instead.

* If you run the task in PHPStorm and the hotkeys are not working, search for
  actions by pressing `STRG+SHIFT+A`, then search for "registry...", then
  enable `nodejs.console.use.terminal` and restart the watcher process.

* Not tested a lot on Windows, please open an issue if you want to contribute.

* If you run into the error `Error NOSPC` or `ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached` on Linux, run the command:

``` shell
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

* Since Magento 2.1 there is a [bug](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/22228) that causes the full page cache records to
  be written to the `var/cache` directory instead of `var/page_cache`.
  This issue causes the cache cleaner behavior to be erratic.
  There is an easy workaround, namely removing all cache configuration from
  the default `app/etc/env.php`. The bug only affects the default config with the
  file system cache backend. Redis or Varnish are not affected.
  The bug will be fixed in the (currently upcoming) Magento 2.3.4 release.

## Thanks

Thanks to [Mage2 TV](https://www.mage2.tv/) for sponsoring the development of
this tool.

This script was inspired by [Timon de Groot](https://twitter.com/TimonGreat)'s
[blog post](https://blog.timpack.org/speed-up-magento-development) where he
describes the idea to use a file watcher in PHPStorm to call `redis-cli` to
clear the complete cache whenever a XML file is modified.
The only downside of that solution is that it always flushes the full cache and
only works with redis.

Thank you also to everybody who gave feedback, shared ideas and helped test new
features! This tool would be impossible without you!
